# Analysis and transformation tools for Go code modernization

Alan A Donovan

From https://www.gophercon.com/agenda/speakers/3698071:

> In this talk, Alan will report recent progress in analysis and refactoring tools for Go. The talk will cover:
> - The principles of the Go analysis framework, which powers batch tools like cmd/vet and interactive tools like gopls, and enables problems to be precisely reported and fixed in real time;
> - a discussion of recent tools to "modernize" your codebase so that it uses the most efficient, clear, and idiomatic features of the newest Go releases; and
> - a demonstration of how our algorithm for precise inlining of function calls is at the heart of a powerful tool for codebase migration.
