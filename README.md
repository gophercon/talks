### Main Theater

#### Go's Next Frontier - Cameron Balahan

Go is more than just a programming language—it's an industry pioneer. From its revolutionary concurrency model to its leadership in open-source security, Go's enduring focus on modern software engineering compels us to not just keep pace with industry advancements but to actively define and lead them.

In this keynote, we’ll explore Go's legacy of leadership and how its core design principles make it well-positioned to lead us into the next frontier: the convergence of AI and programming languages. By examining what the Go team is working on now, we’ll also share a vision of Go’s future developer experience and what we’re most excited about in the AI era.

#### [LLM Agents in Production: Why Go is the Missing Piece - Kartik Ramesh](./2025/LLM%20Agents%20in%20Production:%20Why%20Go%20is%20the%20Missing%20Piece)

You might have heard of this thing called AI agents that have been transforming our industry lately. While there exist a plethora of ways to prototype agents, operating these in production brings a new set of challenges. This talk demonstrates why Go is uniquely suited for building scalable, production-ready agent systems. We'll build an LLM agent from scratch without using any agent frameworks, scale our system out to a multi-agent architecture, and leverage Go's cloud-native ecosystem to operate agents at scale.

#### Goroutines and Cells: Lessons in Goal-Directed Systems - Carlisia Campos

This talk explores a new way to approach concurrency in Go by drawing inspiration from bioelectric signaling in cells. It contrasts how biological systems achieve scalable, decentralized coordination with traditional concurrency patterns such as worker pools and fixed-rate limiters, which often struggle to adapt to dynamic workloads.

Biological systems use graded communication, rhythmic synchronization, and localized interactions to coordinate without centralized control. By applying these principles to Go concurrency, developers can design adaptive, nature-inspired systems that improve efficiency, fault tolerance, and self-organization.

Through conceptual models and real-world analogies, this talk will illustrate:

- How graded signaling enables dynamic resource allocation, reducing bottlenecks in goroutine coordination
- How rhythmic synchronization helps orchestrate periodic tasks more efficiently than independent timers
- How decentralized interactions lead to emergent consensus without centralized control

Attendees will leave with new mental models for designing concurrent systems, gaining insights into how nature-inspired approaches can make Go applications more resilient and scalable.

#### Go: A "Tailor-Made" Language for AWS Lambda - Travis Bale

At Capital One, we're building scalable, high-performance services with Go and AWS Lambda.

This talk will walk through why Go feels like it was designed specifically to work well with AWS Lambda. Attendees will learn about AWS Lambda concepts such as runtimes, cold starts, and extensions, and how Go as a language pairs exceptionally well with them.

#### The Code You Reviewed is Not the Code You Built - Jess McClintock

Ken Thompson's "Reflections on trusting trust" highlights the potential disparity between source code and the final built product, cautioning developers to question their trust model right down to the compiler itself. This principle is crucial when dealing with intricate trust models, as code reviews alone can not provide sufficient assurance in the behaviors of the build artifact.

Earlier this year, a malicious typosquat of the boltdb package was identified on the Go module proxy. There were several things of note about this typosquat, most prominent being the way that the attackers modified the git tags to obfuscate the malicious behavior. Even a security-minded developer who reviewed the code present on GitHub could have been tricked into using this package. In a sense, there were two levels of deception used to ship this code - the typosquat itself and the decoy code present on GitHub. This attack exposes the real-world practicality of deceiving traditional source reviews, threatening the foundation of open source consumption.

#### My Protobuf Module is Faster than Yours (Because I Cheated) - Tom Lyons

When handling over 2 trillion messages every day, every ounce of performance matters. This talk outlines the (over) optimizations that went into making our Go protobuf module as efficient as possible.

#### [Porting the TypeScript Compiler to Go for a 10x Speedup - Jake Bailey](/2025/Porting%20the%20TypeScript%20Compiler%20to%20Go%20for%20a%2010x%20Speedup/README.md)

From the beginning, the TypeScript compiler has been self-hosted, evolving alongside a growing ecosystem of millions of developers. As time went on, we faced challenges with the compiler's performance, largely inherent to the implementation language itself. Through experimentation and testing, we found Go to be an excellent language for our specific needs; a perfect porting language. In this talk, we will explore the process of porting the 150,000+ line TypeScript compiler and its 90,000+ tests to Go, the challenges we faced, lessons we learned, all leading to an overall 10x performance improvement over our previous implementation.

#### [Profiling Request Latency with Critical Path Analysis - Felix Geisendörfer](/2025/Profiling%20Request%20Latency%20with%20Critical%20Path%20Analysis/README.md)

Go ships with great tools for diagnosing performance bottlenecks, with pprof’s CPU profiler being perhaps the most well-known and used tool.

However, when it comes to diagnosing request latency problems, CPU profiling is often insufficient, as Go request latency is usually dominated by Off-CPU waits for downstream services or databases.

This means that developers commonly rely on metrics, traces, or logs to break down their latency problems, requiring them to spend time, money, and even overhead on maintaining the desired level of observability. Despite these efforts, such instrumentation still leaves significant blind spots when it comes to mutex contention, channel bottlenecks, scheduling latency, backoff sleeps, and other Off-CPU waits, especially when they are the cause of high tail latencies.

So what if there was a better way to break down any Go latency issue to the code causing it, that requires zero instrumentation and comes with extremely low overhead?

If that sounds interesting, this talk is for you. You will learn about a novel implementation of critical path analysis to convert runtime execution tracing data into profiles and how you can use it to root cause even the most challenging tail latency problems with minimal effort.

#### Invisible Insight: Strategies for Auto-Instrumenting Go Applications Without Code Changes - Hannah Kim

Instrumenting Go applications without modifying source code has long been a challenge due to the language’s static nature and lack of dynamic code modification capabilities. This talk explores and compares ready-to-use, open-source solutions that enable auto-instrumentation at compile-time and runtime, analyzing their trade-offs in performance, stability, and security. We will cover leading approaches, including eBPF-based solutions, compile-time instrumentation, and runtime techniques such as shared library injection and binary trampoline methods, to assess their feasibility and limitations.

A major focus will be on how community collaboration in OpenTelemetry has made auto-instrumentation a pragmatic reality for Go applications. This session with explore ongoing Go runtime developments that could enable new patterns for auto-instrumentation, including improvements in function call interception, runtime hooks, and tracing APIs (golang/go#63185).

Attendees will gain benchmark-driven insights into these techniques, helping them evaluate the right auto-instrumentation approach for their production environments by balancing observability, performance overhead, and ease of deployment.

Whether you’re an SRE, performance engineer, or Go developer, this talk will provide actionable insights and production-ready open-source tools to integrate into your Go applications today.
